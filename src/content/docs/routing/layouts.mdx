Views in an application often share a lot of common elements, such as navigation, headers, footers, etc. To define the common interface, you can use **layouts**. Layouts are defined much like components, but are stored within `resources/views/layouts/` instead of `resources/views/components/`:

```html title="resources/views/layouts/app.html.php"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Application Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <slot />
    </body>
</html>
```

Within the layout, we define a `slot`-tag, which defines where the view content is meant to be rendered. To use the layout, you can reference it by prefixing `x-layout::` to the layout path:

```html
<x-layout::app>
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
</x-layout::app>
```

### Passing attributes

Much like components, layouts also support passing attributes:

```html title="resources/views/layouts/app.html.php"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{ $title ?? 'Application Title' }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <slot />
    </body>
</html>
```

```html
<x-layout::app title="Dashboard">
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
</x-layout::app>
```
