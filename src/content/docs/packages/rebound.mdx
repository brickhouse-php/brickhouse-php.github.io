description: Package which provides real-time capabilities for Brickhouse.
---

**Rebound** provides your application with real-time capabilities, allowing you to handle events, send updates to your users, or broadcast messages. Rebound supports WebSockets as it's transport layer, making communications between client and server bidirectional.

Rebound can be used for a multitude of applications, such as instant messaging, updating the frontend with new pricing, video game leaderboards, and more.

## Installation

Rebound can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require brickhouse/rebound
```

## The Moving Parts

After installing Rebound, you can mount it in your applications routes:

```php title="routes/app.php"
Rebound::mount('ws', \App\Controllers\ReboundController::class);
```

In this example, `/ws` is routed the controller `ReboundController`, which is defined as:

```php title="src/Controllers/ReboundController.php"
namespace App\Controllers;

use Brickhouse\Http\Controller;
use Brickhouse\Http\Response;
use Brickhouse\Rebound\Websocket\WebsocketClient;

final class ReboundController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Renders a streamed response to the user.
     *
     * @return Response
     */
    public function __invoke(WebsocketClient $client): void
    {
        // Wait for the client to send a message
        foreach ($client as $message) {
            // Send back the message from the client.
            $client->send($message);
        }
    }
}
```

This controller will, in essence, echo everything the client sends back to the client. While not itself useful, it allows for much more complex applications.

You may have noticed the `WebsocketClient` parameter. This instance was injected via the dependency injection container, allowing us to read and write to the client.

## Running the server

To start the Rebound server, run the following command:

```bash
php brickhouse rebound:serve
```

By default, Rebound starts listening on `127.0.0.1:9000`. This is mainly for development and testing purposes, as only the local machine will be able to access it.

If you need to specify a custom host or port, you can do so with the `--host` and `--port` options when starting the server:

```bash
php brickhouse rebound:serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8030
```

Alternatively, you may define the `REBOUND_SERVER_HOST` and `REBOUND_SERVER_PORT` environment variables. Be aware, these environment variables are only used if the server was started without those options. This means that the parameters given to the command will take precedence.
