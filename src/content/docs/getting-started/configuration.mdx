All the configuration files for Brickhouse can be found in the source code of the application, in the `config/` directory. These configuration files allow you to configure things like database connections, cache storage, etc.

Most of the time, you wouldn't need to create any configuration files yourself, as the application template already comes with a sensible default setup.

## Environment files

When creating a new project, you might have seen a couple of `.env` files in the project. These can be used to override parts of the applications configuration, depending on the running environment. So, if you're still developing the application, `.env.development` would be used, `.env.production` for production, and so on. Brickhouse determines which environment the application is currently running by inspecting the `APP_ENV` environment variable. If defined, it determines which environment file to use.

For example, if a configuration file uses `env()` to determine an option:

```php
debug: env("APP_DEBUG", false),
```

It will check if an environment variable named `APP_DEBUG` is set. If so, it uses the value to set the value of `debug`. If it is not set, it uses the second parameters as the "default value."

### Security

It should be noted that the `.env` file should not be commited to your source control, since it often contains sensitive credentials. This would be a security risk in case your source repository ever gets exposed by third parties.

## Current Environment

You can access the currently running environment from inside the application using `Environment::current()`:

```php
use Brickhouse\Config\Environment;

$environment = Environment::current();
```

You can also check if the current environment matches a given value:

```php
if(Environment::is('development')) {
    // The environment is 'development'.
}

if(Environment::is(['development', 'staging'])) {
    // The environment is either 'development' or 'staing'.
}
```

## Configuration Files

Each configuration file within `config` uses the `.config.php` extension to denote that it is a configuration file. Additionally, all configuration files return a configuration object which can be retrieved in the application later:

```php title="config/app.config.php"
<?php

namespace App\Config;

use Brickhouse\Core\AppConfig;

return new AppConfig(
    debug: env("APP_DEBUG", false),
    api_only: false,
);
```

In order to retrieve the configuration, you can use dependency injection:

```php
namespace App\Controllers;

use Brickhouse\Core\AppConfig;
use Brickhouse\Http\Controller;

class GreetingController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        protected readonly AppConfig $config,
    ) {
        $value = $this->config->api_only;
    }
}
```

If you need the configuration outside of a DI-context, you can also use `resolve()`:

```php
use Brickhouse\Core\AppConfig;

$config = resolve(AppConfig::class);
$value = $config->api_only;
```
