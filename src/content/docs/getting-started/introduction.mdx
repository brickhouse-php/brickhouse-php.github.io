**Brickhouse** is ~yet another~ web application framework for PHP. It strives to create a good developer experience whilst not making the framework too rigid for a single use case. It attempts to get out of your way, so you can focus on building your application from start to finish.

Brickhouse can be used to create a variety of different applications, such as blogs, e-commerce, APIs and more. No matter what load volume you're anticipating, Brickhouse will make it easy to get your project off the ground.

## Why Brickhouse?

That's nice and all, but why should you use Brickhouse instead of all the other tried-and-true web frameworks out there? While we can't promise that Brickhouse will fit every use case, we believe that it will help you create scalable, modern applications.

### It's extensible.

**Brickhouse is an all-in-one web framework.** It includes everything you could need to create a website. That doesn't mean it's a single package, 100s of megabytes in size! Brickhouse is built to be extensible from the start, meaning you only install what you need for your project.

Need to build assets for your frontend? Install [Furnace](../packages/furnace). Need a more reactive UI frontend? Try out [Spruce](../packages/spruce). Real-time updates via WebSockets? [Echo](../packages/echo) can help you out.

None of these packages are installed by default, but you can add them all with a single command.

### It's comfy.

Brickhouse strives to create a comfortable development environment. This means you won't have to think about how to implement authentication with JWTs or how to efficiently deploy your application. Brickhouse already has those things planned out for your, which allows you to focus on other tasks.

### It's pretty fast.

No matter your load volume, Brickhouse will do it without a sweat. A cheap VPS can easily handle thousands of requests per second. In fact, we have good support for [FrankenPHP](http://frankenphp.dev) workers, allowing for an amazing speedup compared to PHP FPM.
