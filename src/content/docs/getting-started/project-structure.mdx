Your new Brickhouse projct will already include some files and directories. Otherwise, you may create yourself throughout your applications lifespan.

This page details how Brickhouse applictions are organized.

## Directories and files

Before we go much further, let's take a look at the generated directory structure of the application. If you've worked with Laravel or Ruby on Rails before, many of these will already feel intuitive:

| Folder            | Purpose     |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| `assets/`         | Contains all uncompiled assets which are meant to be served alongside your application. Usually used for CSS, JavaScript, etc. |
| `config/`         | Contains configuration files for all the extensions in your application. |
| `public/`         | Contains all the static files and compiled assets. This directory will be served, as-is. |
| `resources/`      | Contains your view templates, database migrations and other non-source code elements of your application. |
| `routes/`         | Definitions for how the application should route traffic to controllers, actions and commands. |
| `src/`            | Contains most of your application code, such as controllers, models, views and more. |
| `storage/`        | Local storage for items which will outlast the application lifetime, such as logs, caches, databases, etc. |
| `tests/`          | Unit- and feature-tests, fixtures and other testing apparatus. |
| `vendor/`         | Storage directory for all third-party code. |
| `brickhouse`      | Entrypoint for your application and console commands. |
